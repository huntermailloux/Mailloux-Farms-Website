            <h2>About Mailloux Farms</h2>
            <p>Mailloux Farms was founded by Jason Mailloux. He started out by farming a property out in Stoney Point, Ontario that he was renting out. 
            The first property Jason purchased (which is the headquarters of his business) was in 2011, located in St Joachim. Mailloux Farm Headquarters 
            features a house built in 1977 and two big red barns built in 1919. Over the years, he has put considerable time working to improve the business, such as 
            installing new silos for his grain, building additions to the barns for storage, as well as pens for various animals. Since then, Jason and his wife
            / business partner Shana Mailloux purchased a second property in Stoney Point, the same one he rented years ago. As the years go by, Jason has continuously expanded his business 
            with new services and products. Jason continues to keep working on Mailloux Farms to eventually turn it into his full time job and passion.
